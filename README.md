# Amboss Website Scraping Project

The Amboss Website Scraping Project is a robust Python-based application developed to scrape the Amboss website. This project required handling a complex structure with a multitude of folders nested within each other. To overcome this complexity, a recursive function was implemented to efficiently extract data.

## Project Complexity

The Amboss website's data structure posed a unique challenge due to its hierarchical organization. It features multiple folders nested inside each other, making it impractical to scrape manually or with traditional scraping methods.

## Recursive Function

To tackle this complexity, a recursive function was developed as a core component of the scraping process. The recursive function is designed to:

- Traverse through the folder structure.
- Identify and scrape data within each folder.
- Automatically dive deeper into subfolders, repeating the process until all data is collected.

This recursive approach not only simplifies the scraping process but also ensures no data is overlooked, regardless of the depth of the folder structure.
